## Project goal
The goal of this project is to have a paper (game-)controller control an application using nothing but AR-markers.

## Project components
### code
This directory contains the application. It can read the AR-markers mounted on the controller and translate them into three types of buttons (knob, slider, toggle). The application also contains a small physics game to demonstrate a potential application of this technology.

### markers
This directory contains the markers needed for the application

## Usage
Run the application in the code directory in Processing. 

The following software and libraries where used in the latest build:

* Processing 2.1.1
* Box2D for Processing 0.4
* NyARToolkit for proce55ing 1.3.1
